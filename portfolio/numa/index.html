            <figure class='figure-hang-right figure-small figure'>

              <h3 class='h3'>Color</h3>
              <p>The blue is the exact blue that is used with the current identity and will keep brand continuity for the long-time members of the church. It&#8217;s also a good color blue and there was no reason to change it.</p>
              <p>Black and white were then added to the blue forming a simple, high-contrast palette. This approach of black and white with an accent color is tried and true and benefits from always seeming fresh and modern.</p>
              <p>The identity colors are fresh (the old color palette had more colors), but they are based on the foundation of the past.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='g2 d2 center'>
              <h3 class='h3'>Typeface</h3>
              <p>The typeface chosen for the identity is Messina Sans. Many different typefaces were considered, some very similar to this one, others quite different.</p>
              <figure class='figure d2'>
                <div class='figure-img-container'>
                  <img alt='Messina Sans regular and bold, a neo-grotesque sans serif typeface.' class='figure-img' src='../../images/pf-gca-id-typeface.png' title='We later added a full family of complimentary fonts: Harriet Display Light, Maiola Regular and Italic, and Georgia for the web.' width='100%'>
                </div>
              </figure>
              <p class='d2'>Messina San&#8217;s great strength is that it &#8220;feels at home&#8221; in many different settings. It can be used for the website, slides, print materials and feels natural on all of them. One of the reasons for this is the typeface is neutral and interesting at the same time. It&#8217;s neutrality is what helps it never feel out of place. Yet it has a subtle &#8220;personality&#8221; that keeps it from feeling bland or tedious. In particular, the shape of the lower case &#8220;a&#8221; and the capital &#8220;R&#8221; are well executed; which of course bodes well for Grace Church of Alexandria.</p>
            </div>

                <img alt='Grace Church in black all capitals, Alexandria in lowercase blue. All set in bold sans serif.' class='figure-img' src='../../images/pf-gca-id-wordmark.png' title='' width='100%'>
              </div>
            </figure>
            <div class='g2 d2 center'>
              <h3 class='h3'>The Wordmark</h3>
              <p>The old logo included the word &#8220;of&#8221; in the name: Grace Church of Alexandria. In the new wordmark &#8220;of&#8221; has been dropped. There are a couple reasons for this:</p>
              <ol class='typeset-ol'>
                <li>&#8220;Of&#8221; complicates the form of the logo. To have it in front of &#8220;Alexandria&#8221; breaks the cohesive &#8220;GCA&#8221; column and makes the logo seem like more of a phrase than an identity.</li>
                <li class='dp'>It is verbose for a logo. It may seem silly to say one two-letter word is cause for an accusation of such, but with a logo each word is immensely valuable. The same message can be conveyed with three words as with four. In light of this, the word &#8220;of&#8221; did not carry its weight like the rest did.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The result of this decision is a wordmark with three very intentional words.</p>
              <p class='d2 s0'>Also note that this identity is flexible. It could easily accommodate Grace Church Arlington, Grace Church Maryland, and so forth if there were ever convictions to start other church campuses or church plants. And of course it could also accommodate a move away from Alexandria if that ever became necessary.</p>
            </div>

                <img alt='Monolinear symbol in black, three wavy lines locked with two vertical lines on both edges.' class='figure-img' src='../../images/pf-gca-id-mark.png' title='' width='100%'>

            </figure>
            <div class='g2 d2 center'>
              <h3 class='h3'>The Symbol</h3>
              <p>The symbol came out of a few things:</p>
              <p>Water. The flowing shape mimics small waves or ripples on the water. It&#8217;s a place reference to Alexandria and is representative of the primacy of the role the Potomac has played in Alexandria&#8217;s history. It&#8217;s a visual and constant reminder of the commitment to the mission in Alexandria.</p>
              <p>The open Bible. One aspect of Grace Church of Alexandria that was impressed when visiting is the emphasis on strong, deep teaching of the Bible. The mark captures this as a distinguishing feature of the church by presenting the Word of God as open and active.</p>
              <p>The Greek letter &#8220;chi&#8221; was also an influence on the mark. It is the first letter of the Greek word for grace. It is typically written like an &#8220;x&#8221; but with a cursive-esque backslash: &#967;. This is a looser connection than the water and word metaphors, but the curve of the letter chi was a driver in coming to this form.</p>
              <p>In terms of construction, the mark has an original skeleton made of circles that were taken from the approximate shape of the &#8220;C&#8221; in the wordmark. They were then mollified to be more humanistic as opposed to extremely geometric. The line widths match those of the letters of the wordmark and the spacing between the words and the mark are based on the capital letter width of the &#8220;C&#8221; in the wordmark.</p>
            </div>
            <figure class='figure d5 g2 align-g2-center'>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <div class='g2 d3 center'>
              <h3 class='h3'>The Identity</h3>
              <p>There are two elements to the identity: the symbol and the wordmark. Together they form the full logo. The logo will be used in most scenarios: website, banners, slides, letterhead, envelopes, etc. In cases where a square icon is needed, like in most social media settings, the symbol would be used.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='g2 d2 center'>
              <h3 class='h3'>Further Notes</h3>
              <p>When Grace Church of Alexandria is referenced in print there is no special casing or styling applied. It&#8217;s simply Grace Church of Alexandria. The acronym to use if desired is GCA.</p>
              <p>The acronym GCA could also take the form of a monogram. Though in this case it may be more precisely referred to as a stylized acronym, an alternate logo perhaps.</p>
