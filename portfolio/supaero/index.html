                <h1 class='page-lead g2 center'>Completed in 2010, the design of the Wake Forest University website is still mostly in use today. The goal of the project was to accurately reflect the atmosphere and character of the physical university on the website.</h1>
                <p class='dp g2 center'>There is much that could be discussed about this project&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it was extensive, touching numerous departments and offices with many stakeholders involved. But for here I&#8217;m just going to focus briefly on the information architecture and then show some of the completed designs.</p>

                <h3 class='h3'>Information Architecture</h3>
                <p>The first and most difficult hurdle for the site was how to orgnaize the information. For starters, there was a lot of it. You also had disparate audiences using the site on a daily basis. Existing students used the website for far different reasons than a prospective parent, and they all differed from a prospective student; all of which were very different from the staff, faculty and alumni. And then there was an entire &#8220;news&#8221; component to the site that had to be planned and implemented from scratch.</p>
                <p>Speaking generally the audiences could be grouped into three large, loose categories: prospective, academic and institutional&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;further defined as students, parents, faculty, alumni, and staff. This classification worked well for segmenting the types of people who visited the site but it wasn&#8217;t always the clearest way to organize content. For example the Academics page could belong under Students, Faculty or Parents depending on which portion of the topic was being discussed.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>We explored a straight topical organization, but found that to be insufficient for areas where the audience-based approach worked perfectly (e.g. alumni and parents).</p>
                <p>A two-tiered approach of major and minor was common as we looked at other university websites. And then there was the always tempting approach of the iceberg method to where you pile everything under complex dropdown menus. The former didn&#8217;t completely fit our needs and the latter we agreed was a cop-out, the poor usability issues of such a solution notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>So, in a don&#8217;t try this at home moment, we combined the audience-based grouping with a topical system and arrived at three tiers of information, or navigation. The three tiers were: major (audiences), minor (academic-focused) and an &#8220;application bar&#8221; (what we called it at the time) which was meant to contain popular links. As always, these rules were bent a bit to accommodate wishes here and there, but in general that was the framework. You can see the end result in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</p>

                <p>A sampling of some of the designs are shown below. Keep in mind this was six years ago; technological implementations of webfonts and responsive design were still in their infancy. In fact, when this project was started the phrase &#8220;responsive design&#8221; hadn&#8217;t even been coined yet. It wasn&#8217;t until later in the year that the idea was presented in full and named in an <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">A List Apart article</a>.</p>
                <p>However, I will say we were quick to put into practice what we learned: there&#8217;s a @media query to move the logo slightly outside of the page margins so the shield hangs left when the browser viewport is greater than 1080px. Obviously not anywhere near what responsive design is comprehensively, but an enhancement nonetheless and something that allows me to say I&#8217;ve been doing responsive design for six years. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
