        <div class='page-content frame clear'>
          <h2 class='g1 align-g2-center'>Below is the typical process for building a website. Sometimes steps are skipped, sometimes steps are added. It all hangs on the mantra of &#8220;it depends.&#8221;</h2>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Discovery</h3>
            <p>There are lots of things in your head that have to get out on the table. I ask the questions to do this. Some liken it to therapy. Either way this step in some ways is the most essential.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Audit</h3>
            <p>If you have a pre-existing website we review and categorize everything. This is accomplished in a shared spreadsheet (e.g. Google Docs).</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Content Strategy</h3>
            <p>&#8220;Content is king&#8221; is preached often. Here we believe it and therefore practice it. A website without good content is like alcohol for dinner. Fun the first time but not a sustainable strategy. I have a Content Strategy Questionnaire that is tailored to each client and each project. Answers lead to follow-up questions and round we go.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>Using the spreadsheet created in the Site Audit phase, we now view it through the lense of the content strategy. Content is culled, created and combined to create the information architecture of your new website.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Content Outline</h3>
            <p>Now that the strategy is established and the information architecture created, we create a new document called a content outline. This is were we start collecting actual content that will go on the website. New content that needs to be written is written and existing content that needs to be edited is edited.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>CMS Setup</h3>
            <p>I use WordPress, but any CMS will do (well, except for a few, you know who you are). With the information architecture and content outline in place the backend data structure of the website is straight-forward to setup.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g1 d2 align-g2-center'>
            <p class='s0'>Once the CMS is setup, your content team can begin to build out the content on the live site. A base layout and visual structure will be in place so that your team can begin to see the content come to life. This allows the content and design &amp; build phase to run concurrently saving us both time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Design</h3>
            <p>I design with a blend of tools: Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator and CSS &amp; HTML. Different circumstances call for different tools. You don't need to worry about which tools I'm using, you just approve and give feedback. There are many feedback cycles in the design phase to make sure we are continuously on the same page. Sometimes there are grand reveals, most of the time it's a slow and steady pace towards a stellar look and feel.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Build</h3>
            <p>All parts of the design are converted to a native web document: HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Integrate</h3>
            <p>All parts of the website are integrated into the CMS.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Test</h3>
            <p>Thankfully browser testing isn&#8217;t the beast it used to be. But now of course we must test a variation of internet-capable devices, different computers and the like. In addition to visual bugs, functionality is tested, (spellcheck!), etc.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Launch!</h3>
            <p>Party time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='g2 d2 center'>
            <h3 class='h3'>Iterate, Analyze, Update</h3>
